## Introduction
This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect colorectal cancer using medical image datasets. The application uses TensorFlow for model training and Django for building a web-based interface for prediction.

## Features
- Image upload for cancer prediction.
- Web-based UI for model interaction.
- TensorFlow-based backend for accurate predictions.

## Requirements
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Conda (Anaconda/Miniconda)
- TensorFlow 2.15.0

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SurrajKumar2000/Colorectal-Cancer-Detection-CNN-method.git
   cd Colorectal-Cancer-Detection-CNN-method
   
2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**:
Use Conda to create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   conda create --name colorectal-cancer-detection python=3.8 -y
   conda activate colorectal-cancer-detection

3. **Install Project Dependencies**:
Once the virtual environment is activated, install all the required dependencies. If you have a requirements.txt file, you can install the dependencies using the following command:
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

5. **Run the Server**:
To start the Django development server and run the project locally, use the following command:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver

6. **Access the Application**:
Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to the following URL to access the application:
   ```bash
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/
